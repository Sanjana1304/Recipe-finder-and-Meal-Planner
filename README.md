# Recipe finder and Meal Planner App

- I have developed a comprehensive Recipe Finder and Meal Planner app using **React.js** to enhance users' culinary experiences. This app empowers users to find recipes based on ingredients available in their fridge, enabling them to make the most out of what they have at home. Additionally, it provides detailed nutrition facts for each recipe, helping users stay informed about their dietary choices. Users can save their favorite recipes for future use and browse through a wide range of available recipes for inspiration. Furthermore, the app offers personalized meal plans for the day, tailored to users' specific dietary preferences and caloric goals. This all-in-one solution aims to simplify meal preparation, promote healthy eating, and reduce food waste.

### In my recipe and meal planner app, I utilized multiple APIs to enhance my learning experience.
- ### For recipe search results, I used the API Ninjas API.
- ### To fetch nutrition facts, I integrated the Edamam API.
- ### For meal planning and ingredient-based recipes, I employed the Spoonacular API.
- ### Additionally, to save recipes, I launched a localhost server since this is just a front-end project built with React.js.

## Built on
- Visual Studio Code

### Further Development
- This project can be further developed by integrating Express.js and Node.js to create a robust backend. Using these technologies, we can build RESTful APIs to handle user authentication, manage recipe data, and store user preferences. Implementing a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL will enable efficient storage and retrieval of user details, saved recipes, and meal plans. With user authentication, we can offer personalized experiences, such as custom meal recommendations and secure access to saved recipes. Additionally, leveraging the power of Node.js and Express.js will allow for seamless server-side processing and improved performance, making the app more scalable and responsive. This combination will transform the project into a full-stack application with enhanced functionality and user engagement.
